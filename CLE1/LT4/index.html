                <h2>Tulips</h2>
                <h4>Sylvia Plath</h4> <br><br>
                <p>The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.<br><br>
                    Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.<br><br>
                    I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly<br><br>
                    As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.<br><br>
                    I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.<br><br>
                    I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses<br><br>
                    And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.<br><br>
                    They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff<br><br>
                    Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.<br><br>
                    Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.<br><br>
                    The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,<br><br>
                    They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,<br><br>
                    Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,<br><br>
                    So it is impossible to tell how many there are.<br><br>
                    My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water<br><br>
                    Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.<br><br>
                    They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.<br><br>
                    Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage——<br><br>
                    My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,<br><br>
                    My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;<br><br>
                    Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.<br><br>
                    I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat
                    stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.<br><br>
                    They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.<br><br>
                    Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley
                    I watched my teaset, <br><br>my bureaus of linen, my books
                    Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.<br><br>
                    I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.<br><br>
                    I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
                    To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.<br><br>
                    How free it is, you have no idea how free——
                    The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,<br><br>
                    And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.<br><br>
                    It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
                    Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.<br><br>
                    The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.<br><br>
                    Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
                    Lightly, through their white swaddlings,<br><br> like an awful baby.
                    Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.<br><br>
                    They are subtle they seem to float, though they weigh me down,
                    <br><br>Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
                    A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.<br><br>
                    Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.<br><br>
                    The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
                    Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,<br><br>
                    And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
                    Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,<br><br>
                    And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.<br><br>
                    The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.<br><br>
                    Before they came the air was calm enough,<br><br>
                    Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.<br><br>
                    Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.<br><br>
                    Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
                    Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.<br><br>
                    They concentrate my attention, that was happy
                    Playing and resting without committing itself.<br><br>
                    The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.<br><br>
                    The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals<br><br>
                    They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,<br><br>
                    And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
                    Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.<br><br>
                    The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
                    And comes from a country far away as health.<br><br>
